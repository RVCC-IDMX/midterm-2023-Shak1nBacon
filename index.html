      <li>"I had 8 hours to chop down a tree, so I talked to Ismail for 7 hours and with his assistance and Website development skills, he was able to make me a website where he expressed my need for help and I got connected with someone in 5 Minutes and the tree was cut down and the day was saved. Turns out that guy knew someone who knew someone else and connected me with an marketing agency that helped me become a US President. All thanks to Ismail." </li>
